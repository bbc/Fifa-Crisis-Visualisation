AFP PHOTO / FABRICE COFFRINI (Photo credit should read FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images) | FABRICE COFFRINI via Getty Images\n\nThe first official business day of Fifa's 65th annual congress on Friday was riddled with high drama, as first protesters had to be removed by security, then a bomb scare, and finally intense last-minute negotiations over a plot to ban Israel from world football, all threatened to overshadow the day's events.\n\nBefore the day's highly-anticipated proceedings had even begun, two pro-Palestinian protesters were ejected from the Congress hall after making their way inside and disrupting President Sepp Blatter's opening remarks, forcing the 79-year-old to call for a security sweep of the building.\n\nThen, just as delegates had filed into the hall and events were about to get under way, Zurich police ordered an emergency evacuation, having received a credible bomb threat at 11am local time (10:00 BST).\n\nAll the while a demonstration calling for Israel to be suspended from Fifa continued outside the venue with footage showing a large group of demonstrators later attempting to storm the building.\n\nAfter Blatter's opening address came the news that the Israeli Football Association (IFA) had agreed to four out of five demands from their Palestinian counterparts, who were due to propose a motion that would bar Israel from world football. Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), announced at 2:30 on Friday afternoon his delegates would be dropping the motion against Israel.\n\nThese increased tensions will do little to stem the already fanatical interest that Fifa's conference has attracted in lieu of its President announcing he would not bend to pressure from world leaders to resign, after several of his colleagues were arrested on corruption charges.\n\nThe 79-year-old Swiss football administrator is seeking re-election for a fifth term to remain in the top Fifa post, having held the role for 17 years.\n\nBlatter faced a barrage of criticism after high-ranking officials close to him, including Vice President Jeffrey Webb, were arrested in a dawn raid by US officials as part of a suspected $150m bribery sting.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron launched an attack on the Fifa President in Berlin on Friday, calling on Blatter to step down from his role.\n\n\"You cannot have accusations of corruption at this level and on this scale in this organisation and pretend that the person currently leading it is the right person to take it forward,\" he said.\n\n\"That cannot be the case. Frankly, what we've seen is the ugly side of the beautiful game and he should go. And the sooner that happens, the better.\"\n\nHis comments came in response to Blatter's opening address to Fifa conference attendees, in which he attempted to lay to rest the fierce criticism leveled against him.\n\n\"Today I appeal for a team spirit, unity, so we can advance together. It may not be easy but that is why we are here today,\" he told assembled delegates.\n\n\"We cannot watch everyone all the time. We have 1.6 billion people directly or indirectly touched by our game.\"\n\nZURICH, SWITZERLAND - MAY 29: Jibril Al Rajoub, President of the Palestinian Football Association talks during the 65th FIFA Congress at the Hallenstadion on May 29, 2015 in Zurich, Switzerland.

In May 2011, Visa asked Fifa to \"take all necessary steps to resolve the concerns that have been raised\" amid a corruption scandal at Fifa.\n\nLast week, Visa also told Fifa it had \"grave concerns\" about reports of abuses of migrant workers building stadiums for the Qatar event.","authors":["Agency Staff"],"feed-id":189,"published":"2015-05-28T10:06:25Z"},{"description":"FIFA said in a statement Monday that it has \"no legal grounds\" to remove the 2018 and 2022 World Cup competitions from Russia and Qatar, despite widespread speculation that bribery led to the awarding of soccer's biggest event to the regions back in 2010.","source":{"source-uuid":"92b8466f-c8dd-4e9a-b4ff-3f25cbdd9613","source-id":73,"source-name":"Los Angeles Times"},"title":"FIFA: 'No legal grounds' to remove World Cup from Russia, Qatar","concepts":[{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thing","count":1,"surface_form":"FIFA World Cup","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/FIFA_World_Cup","label":"FIFA World Cup","score":0.709573826786416,"types":[]},{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","count":3,"surface_form":"Qatar","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Qatar","label":"Qatar","score":0.5487390576167925,"types":["http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl#Location","http://schema.org/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Wikidata:Q532","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://schema.org/Country","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country"]},{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","count":4,"surface_form":"Russia","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia","label":"Russia","score":0.5200911573996141,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Wikidata:Q532","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://schema.org/Country","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country","http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl#Location","http://schema.org/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place"]},{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","count":1,"surface_form":"Zurich","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Z%C3%BCrich","label":"Zurich","score":0.5106404748872375,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Wikidata:Q532","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Settlement","http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl#Location","http://schema.org/Place"]},{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","count":1,"surface_form":"Swiss","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Switzerland","label":"Swiss","score":0.4845183283650569,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Wikidata:Q532","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://schema.org/Country","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country","http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl#Location","http://schema.org/Place"]}],"id":"fcfcdb40f86aa3551d1377cff39cd897a641102b","url":"http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-fifa-world-cup-russia-qatar-20150608-story.html","image":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-5575f3e1/turbine/la-sp-sn-fifa-world-cup-russia-qatar-20150608","source-id":73,"body":"FIFA said in a statement Monday that it has \"no legal grounds\" to remove the 2018 and 2022 World Cup competitions from Russia and Qatar, despite widespread speculation that bribery led to the awarding of soccer's biggest event to the regions back in 2010.\n\n\"Russia and Qatar were awarded the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups by democratic vote of the Executive Committee,\" FIFA said, according to CNN. \"Based on expert opinions and available facts, FIFA has no legal grounds to take away the hosting of the FIFA World Cup from Russia and Qatar.\"\n\nIt added: \"We will not speculate on possible scenarios and therefore have no further comments for the time being.\"\n\nThe statement followed comments to the contrary that Domenico Scala, FIFA's compliance committee chief, made to a Swedish newspaper.\n\n\"Should evidence be present that the awarding to Qatar and Russia only came about with bought votes, then the awarding could be void,\" Scala said.\n\nOn May 27, the U.S. Department of Justice unveiled federal racketeering charges against 14 people, including nine current and former FIFA executives, with seven people arrested near the organization's headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nSwiss authorities also seized documents from FIFA offices as part of a separate criminal investigation into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.\n\nAlexesy Sorokin, the CEO of Russia World Cup 2018, told CNN last week that Russia's bid \"was clean.

Justice unveiled federal racketeering charges against 14 people, including nine current and former FIFA executives, with seven people arrested near the organization's headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nSwiss authorities also seized documents from FIFA offices as part of a separate criminal investigation into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.\n\nAlexesy Sorokin, the CEO of Russia World Cup 2018, told CNN last week that Russia's bid \"was clean.

This starts with rebuilding a culture with strong ethical practices in order to restore the reputation of the games for fans everywhere.\"\n\nVisa joins a growing list of companies pressuring Fifa after authorities outlined years of alleged corruption at the organisation. According to the US Justice Department, Fifa officials received bribes and kickbacks that were meant to influence the awarding of media and marketing rights, along with the choice of the host country for the 2010 World Cup.\n\nVisa, the world’s biggest bank-card network, last year extended its deal with Fifa to the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 event in Qatar. The firm was among five marketing partners for the 2018 tournament listed on Zurich-based Fifa’s website. Wednesday’s statement is not the first time the lender has pressed Fifa to act quickly.\n\nVisa issued a similarly worded statement in November, when it told Fifa to \"act accordingly and take swift action\" after criticism of bidding for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. In May 2011, Visa asked Fifa to \"take all necessary steps to resolve the concerns that have been raised\" amid a corruption scandal at Fifa.\n\nLast week, Visa also told Fifa it had \"grave concerns\" about reports of abuses of migrant workers building stadiums for the Qatar event.","authors":["Agency Staff"],"feed-id":189,"published":"2015-05-28T10:06:25Z"},{"description":"Russia will host the next football World Cup, and with three years to go before the finals, FIFA has called the level of racism in the Russian game \"completely unacceptable\".","source":{"source-uuid":"4b9b4468-1395-4a38-b580-82618d0cc90b","source-id":1,"source-name":"BBC News"},"title":"Russia football racism 'too common', as World Cup looms","concepts":[{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Organisation","count":1,"surface_form":"Fifa","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/FIFA","label":"FIFA","score":0.5430057992024704,"types":["http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","http://schema.org/Organization","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Organisation"]},{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","count":1,"surface_form":"Russia","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia","label":"Russia","score":0.5175912164704406,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country","http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing","http://schema.org/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://schema.org/Country"]}],"id":"f4afbddf1b0c7fdd4a975864ad380b245cce8f39","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-31653569","image":"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/81277000/jpg/_81277843_81277812.jpg","source-id":1,"body":"Russia will host the next football World Cup and with three years to go before the finals, Fifa has called the level of racism in the Russian game \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nThe 2018 event is also clouded by other controversies -

Incumbent Blatter was the favourite to be voted in against his only opponent, Prince Ali Bin Hussein of Jordan, but that could change after the latest revelations of bribery.\n\nMurray believes Blatter's chances of being re-elected have taken a big hit as a result of the most significant allegations of corruption yet and does not believe FIFA can repair its tarnished image under his control.\n\n\"All this happened during Blatter's governance. I think a lot of them will have second thoughts about voting for Blatter and I think this incident will have delivered quite a number of votes to his opponent, Prince Ali,\" Murray said.  \"[Blatter] must have known what was going on. There's never been any hard proof that I have seen that suggests that Blatter is corrupt or he took a bribe. But what is clear is that a lot of people did [take bribes] during his governance and nobody would believe that he didn't know about it. I don't think FIFA can continue and try to regain credibility with Blatter still at the helm.''\n\nWhile a re-vote of the widely criticised process for the 2022 World Cup remains some way off, Murray suggests Blatter was the only FIFA Executive Committee member to vote for Australia.\n\n\"My sources are telling me that it wasn't The Kaiser [Franz Beckenbauer] who voted for Australia, it was Sepp Blatter,\" Murray said.\n\nFairfax Media sources provided information supporting this claim, confirming that senior officials of Australia's bidding team received a call from Blatter informing them of

Then, as now, the poll was held amid high-profile carnage and red-hot wreckage of a corruption scandal involving officials in Fifa’s innermost sanctum.\n\nThen, as now, President Sepp Blatter blamed the graft scandal blighting his global administration of football on exalted but wayward and evasive individuals on the Fifa high table. On both occasions, it was about allegations of corruption bedevilling the process that made Russia and Qatar hosts of the 2018 and 2022 Fifa World Cups respectively.\n\nAs a fig leaf, Fifa hired American lawyer Michael Garcia to investigate accusations that its all-powerful 22-member Executive Committee was bribed to make Russia and Qatar World Cup hosts. When he handed in his report last November, Fifa publicly said Mr Garcia had cleared the organisation of the charges of bribery.\n\nFour years ago, as three days ago, Mr Blatter cast himself as the person best positioned to both reform and rid Fifa of corruption. On Friday, as in 2011, Mr Blatter, who has been at Fifa for 40 years, presented himself as the stalwart who would not allow his beloved organisation to be dragged through the muck of corruption.\n\nBut this simple question portends a huge test: Can he rid Fifa of graft now when he has been helmsman for 17 years? Fifa requires inclusivity, transparency and accountability, which are unlikely to come from within.\n\nHere’s why. If Fifa was a business, auditors would have scrutinised its books of account and the board and shareholders would long ago have demanded the exit of Mr Blatter & Co. Fifa is not a business but an exclusive club for an elitist clique whose members cannot make demands of Mr Blatter.\n\nIf Fifa were a non-governmental organisation, it would get donor funds as the principal recipient and disburse these to sub-recipients (SRs) to carry out specific projects. The SRs would be required to account to Fifa which would, in turn, be held to account by the donor. Nobody holds Fifa to account.\n\nIf the six confederations that make up Fifa were answerable to respective national football bodies and they, in turn, were answerable to local football fraternities (we, the fans), then, there would be bottom-up and up-down lines of answerability. That is not the case here.\n\nFifa rules the world’s truly global and most popular sport, which is awash with money. That means power: Brazil changed its law to allow for the sale of alcohol at the 2014 World Cup venues because Fifa demanded it because a beer-maker is its sponsor.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2014 World Cup, FIFA.com reported in a post titled FAQ: Setting the record straight that: “In fact, Fifa spends 550,000 USD on worldwide football development — every single day. What is more, we also spend nearly 2 million USD on organising international competitions — every single day.”\n\nIn March, Business Insider, quoting Fifa’s 2014 financial statement, reported that the organisation generated US$4.8 billion from the World Cup in Brazil in revenue and a profit of US$2.6 billion. Of the money so generated, US$2.4 billion was from TV rights fees, US$1.6 billion from sponsorships and US$527 million in ticket sales.\n\nBut Fifa did not contribute to the construction of stadia or transport infrastructure, which gobbled up most of the US$15 billion Brazil spent on the World Cup. That was borne by Brazilian taxpayers. Fifa invests zilch to get rich; exploits dirt poor fans to get filthy rich!\n\nExclusive, rich and powerful, Fifa cannot reform itself. But corporate sponsors Coca-Cola, VISA, Hyundai, KIA and Adidas, and others, which back Fifa to the tune of US$50 million annually, can force the organisation on the path of reform.","authors":["More This Author"],"feed-id":140,"published":"2015-05-30T17:14:12Z"},{"description":"[caption id=","source":{"source-uuid":"1af2c667-405c-48a5-95a2-afe9785bbc96","source-id":35,"source-name":"Kenya Broadcasting Corporation"},"title":"Brazilian gov’t to investigate arrest of FIFA officials","concepts":[{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","count":1,"surface_form":"Brazil","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil","label":"Brazil","score":0.5808244223286414,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Wikidata:Q532","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://schema.org/Country","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country","http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl#Location","http://schema.org/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place"]},{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","count":1,"surface_form":"Zurich","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Z%C3%BCrich","label":"Zurich","score":0.5107835800227747,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Wikidata:Q532","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Settlement","http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl#Location","http://schema.org/Place"]}],"id":"a58fa02f3c90c359946b4cc598cf57e95b831bbc","url":"http://www.kbc.co.ke/brazilian-govt-to-investigate-arrest-of-fifa-officials/","image":"","source-id":35,"body":"Brazilian government says they will investigate accusations that led to the arrest of seven FIFA officials, including the vice chairman of the Brazilian Football Confederation.\n\nJose Maria Marin, was arrested in an early morning raid at a luxury Zurich hotel, following an investigation by the US Attorney General’s office alleging massive corruption.\n\nBrazilian broadcasting executive Jose Margulies, is also listed on the indictment sheet.

England defeated Germany 1-0 in extra time. Erich Schlegel-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Lionesses gained some consolation for their heartbreaking loss to Japan in the semi-final as they produced a gritty display to beat the twice world champions for the first time.\n\nA fiercely competitive game, scoreless after 90 minutes, was decided three minutes into the second period of extra time when England sub Lianne Sanderson was pulled down in the box by Tabea Kemme and Williams coolly slotted home.\n\nThe third place finish, behind United States and Japan who meet in the final on Sunday, is the best by an England team at a women's World Cup.\n\nIt also marks the best finish by an England team of either gender since the men’s team won the World Cup in 1966.\n\n\"These players are just incredible. Now it's time for a massive celebration,\" said England coach Mark Sampson.\n\nGermany, who had won 18 of the previous 20 meetings between the teams, started strongly and forced England keeper Karen Bardsley into action early with a powerful first minute header from forward Lena Peterman. An injury time own goal from Japan had doomed England in the semi-final and there was almost more self-inflicted damage when a header from Jo Potter flew past Bardsley only for skipper Steph Houghton to produce a brilliant clearance on the line.\n\nBardsley was outstanding again in the 53rd minute to keep out a superb volley from Sara Dabritz and then Kemme shot just wide after a powerful run in from the left flank.\n\nEngland finished strongly, though, camping deep in the German half and keeper Nadine Angerer did well to save bravely at the feet of substitute Eniola Aluko.\n\nGermany dominated the first period of extra-time but the Lionesses found a second wind and the decisive penalty was reward for their pressure.\n\nGermany coach Silvia Neid, who will stand down next year, said she had no complaints about the penalty or the result.\n\n\"We fought, we worked very well and had chances but if you don’t score you aren’t going to win. The penalty was justified, we were very naive. It is sad but it is reality but England won and deserved to win,\" she said.","authors":["Reuters Editorial"],"feed-id":104,"published":"2015-07-05T00:03:37Z"},{"description":"Taiwo Awoniyi scored twice, as Nigeria's U-20 side defeated Hungary 2-0 to qualify for the round of 16, at the ongoing FIFA U-20 World Cup in New Zealand.","source":{"source-uuid":"5eef6b4e-b84a-4742-80ba-af3c5ea4c15f","source-id":100,"source-name":"Daily Post (Nigeria)"},"title":"FIFA U-20 World Cup: Flying Eagles beat Hungary, to play Germany in round of 16","concepts":[{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","count":1,"surface_form":"Nigeria","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nigeria","label":"Nigeria","score":0.5348687457564658,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Wikidata:Q532","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://schema.org/Country","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country","http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl#Location","http://schema.org/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place"]},{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","count":1,"surface_form":"Germany","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany","label":"GerMany","score":0.4988732966716337,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Wikidata:Q532","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://schema.org/Country","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country","http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl#Location","http://schema.org/Place"]},{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","count":1,"surface_form":"Hungary","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hungary","label":"Hungary","score":0.4745208322118735,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://schema.org/Country","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country","http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl#Location","http://schema.org/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Wikidata:Q532"]}],"id":"52a1ed4d0973c0362c1704c87d3071d619b60c88","url":"http://dailypost.ng/2015/06/07/fifa-u-20-world-cup-flying-eagles-beat-hungary-to-play-germany-in-round-of-16/","image":"http://cdn.dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Awoniyi-Hungary-June2015-150x150.png?a1f46c","source-id":100,"body":"Taiwo Awoniyi scored twice, as Nigeria’s U-20 side defeated Hungary 2-0 to qualify for the round of 16, at the ongoing FIFA U-20 World Cup in New Zealand.\n\nThe Flying Eagles needed a win or a draw to progress and promptly took charge of the game played at the Stadium Taranaki.\n\nAs a result, Manu Garba’s boys will now take on European champions, Germany on June 11, 2015 at the Christ-Church Stadium.\n\nNigeria is seeking to win the age group competition for the first time at this level.","authors":["Ifreke Inyang"],"feed-id":145,"published":"2015-06-07T07:57:23Z"},{"description":"The Copa America regional football tournament kicks off Thursday, with hosts Chile eager to claim a historic first title and Brazil – epically humiliated by Germany last year – geared up to make amends with fans back home.","source":{"source-uuid":"518a5f19-2a6d-47d3-be89-07752a616805","source-id":88,"source-name":"France24"},"title":"Chile welcomes Copa America amid FIFA scandal","concepts":[],"id":"6aef7f7db96bf9e6ea88b7bfdd4f249c2be53f73","url":"http://www.france24.com/en/20150610-football-copa-america-2015-chile-fifa-corruption-scandal-soccer","image":"http://scd.france24.com/en/files/imagecache/france24_ct_api_bigger_169/article/image/100615-copa-america-2015-m_0.jpg","source-id":88,"body":"© 2015 Copyright France 24 – All rights reserved\n\n France 24 is not responsible for the content of external websites","authors":[],"feed-id":130,"published":"2015-06-10T12:22:50Z"},{"description":"All of those years working in a nuclear power plant appear to have given Homer Simpson psychic abilities.

transparency and accountability,” Obama said at a news conference. \"As the investigation and charges proceed, I think we have to keep in mind that although football, soccer, depending on which side

Canada won 1-0. Ian Kucerak/Edmonton Sun/Postmedia Network\n\nThe game did not live up to the occasion.\n\nBut as Canada headed towards a scoreless tie against China in the opening game of the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup, Ukrainian referee Kateryna Monzul handed the hosts a lifeline.\n\nA late penalty converted by captain Christine Sinclair, allowed Canada to pull out a 1-0 win over China in front of a record crowd of 53,058 at Commonwealth Stadium.\n\n“It was a penalty, all credit to the referee,” said Canadian head coach John Herdman. “It was a brave decision. Some refs sort of overlook those ones, because it was a bump, it wasn’t blatantly obvious like a trip or something like that once you’re in on goal. I thought she (Monzul) was brave, very brave and she had a very good game. If that’s the standard of referees in this tournament, this is going to be a solid tournament.”\n\nChinese defender Rong Zhao was ruled to have fouled Canadian substitute Adriana Leon in the penalty area as the two battled for a ball.\n\nIt seemed a generous, hometown call and Sinclair capitalized.\n\n“To begin with we’re here to play the game and we respect all the rules,” said China’s head coach Wei Hao, through an interpreter. “Whether it was a penalty or not, I didn’t see it clearly, I need to watch a video afterwards,\"\n\nOutside of the late penalty, Canada was uninspiring, but they will take the three points for the win and move on.\n\nIt might have helped had their opponent been interesting in engaging, but the Chinese were out to survive, forcing Canada to do most of the heavy lifting.\n\n“Only five or six years ago, Canada would have been defending in a huge block against the Chinese, who were among the best soccer nations in the world,” Herdman said. “I’m really proud that Canada can come out and dominate a game in terms of the possession and sneak a win. That’s what we wanted, the three points that’s the most important part.”\n\nThe result gives Canada the leg up in Group A, with games against New Zealand and Netherlands left to play.\n\nConsidering the magnitude of the event, the Canadians could be excused for being tentative against a Chinese team set up to absorb pressure. The Canadians were limited to a handful of chances in the contest, the majority coming in the fist half.\n\nKadeisha Buchanan had the first good opportunity of the game, three minutes in, when a free kick from Sophie Schmidt fell to her at the far post.\n\nBuchanan hammered a shot that was stopped by Chinese goalkeeper Fei Wang, who also got in the way of the rebound.\n\nSinclair came close five minutes later, sent in on a ball over the top by Melissa Tancredi. Sinclair got to it behind the Chinese defensive line but sailed her left-foot attempt just wide.\n\nChina’s best two opportunities came via giveaways from Canadian centre back Lauren Sesselmann. The first on a back pass that fell short, forcing goalkeeper Erin McLeod to dive out at the feet of Chinese striker Shanshan Wang to take the ball away.\n\nThe second came when Sesselmann missed Desire Scott with a square ball at the back, forcing the midfielder to take down Wang, who intercepted the pass. Scott was booked for the late tackle and Wang went on to rattle the ball off the crossbar then down onto the goalpost and out.\n\nCanada countered China’s close call with one of their own, as Belanger splintered the crossbar after goalkeeper Wang punched a cross out to her.\n\n“I was happy we got that win, it was an amazing atmosphere to go off and kick off the World Cup in front of 50,000-plus fans,” said Schmidt, who was voted player of the game. “The heat was something special (Saturday) was well, but I’m so proud of our team we pushed through and got the win. The first half was a little rough, but we found our feet, and in the second half, we never let up.”\n\nIn the second half, Canada tried to increase the pressure, but were still tentative coming forward in order to keep from giving up a goal against the run of play.\n\nThe Chinese were content to put most of their players behind the ball and only threatened when Canada got sloppy with possession.\n\nUnable to work their way through a sea of bodies in the penalty area, Canadian coach tried to inject some energy into his squad by bringing on Kaylyn Kyle, Jesse Fleming and Leon.\n\nAs the game headed into extra time, Leon and Zhao got tangled battling for a ball in the penalty area, leading to the Canadian victory.\n\n“China sat back and kind of dared us to come at them, and finally something went our way,” Schmidt said. “And Sincy, oh captain, my captain, came through and I’m glad she put that in.”","authors":["Derek Van Diest"],"feed-id":425,"published":"2015-06-07T15:21:27Z"},{"description":"The game did not live up to the occasion.","source":{"source-uuid":"075f4b26-4fbd-40aa-ab92-9c6394273095","source-id":297,"source-name":"Calgary Sun"},"title":"Canada captain Christine Sinclair pulls out the win with dying-minutes penalty k","concepts":[{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","count":1,"surface_form":"Netherlands","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands","label":"Netherlands","score":0.5206663193236982,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country","http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl#Location","http://schema.org/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Wikidata:Q532","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://schema.org/Country"]},{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","count":61,"surface_form":"Edmonton","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edmonton","label":"Edmonton","score":0.5118642148081465,"types":["http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl#Location","http://schema.org/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Wikidata:Q532","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Settlement","http://schema.org/City","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/City"]},{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","count":1,"surface_form":"New Zealand","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Zealand","label":"New zealand","score":0.4881416024984646,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Wikidata:Q532","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://schema.org/Country","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country","http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl#Location","http://schema.org/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place"]},{"generic-type":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","count":16,"surface_form":"Canada's","uri":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canada","label":"Canada's","score":0.48068931041801566,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Wikidata:Q532","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://schema.org/Country","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country","http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl#Location","http://schema.org/Place"]}],"id":"eac1c024493862de3ad8563497b57a3d1053fd80","url":"http://www.calgarysun.com/2015/06/06/canada-captain-christine-sinclair-pulls-out-the-win-with-dying-minutes-penalty-kick","image":"http://storage.calgarysun.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297709419421_LARGE_BOX.jpg?quality=80&stmp=1433691175671&size=100x","source-id":297,"body":"Canadian fans wait for the start of the FIFA Women''s World Cup at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, Alberta on Saturday June 6, 2015.

Canada won 1-0. Ian Kucerak/Edmonton Sun/Postmedia Network\n\nThe game did not live up to the occasion.\n\nBut as Canada headed towards a scoreless tie against China in the opening game of the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup, Ukrainian referee Kateryna Monzul handed the hosts a lifeline.\n\nA late penalty converted by captain Christine Sinclair, allowed Canada to pull out a 1-0 win over China in front of a record crowd of 53,058 at Commonwealth Stadium.\n\n“It was a penalty, all credit to the referee,” said Canadian head coach John Herdman. “It was a brave decision. Some refs sort of overlook those ones, because it was a bump, it wasn’t blatantly obvious like a trip or something like that once you’re in on goal. I thought she (Monzul) was brave, very brave and she had a very good game. If that’s the standard of referees in this tournament, this is going to be a solid tournament.”\n\nChinese defender Rong Zhao was ruled to have fouled Canadian substitute Adriana Leon in the penalty area as the two battled for a ball.\n\nIt seemed a generous, hometown call and Sinclair capitalized.\n\n“To begin with we’re here to play the game and we respect all the rules,” said China’s head coach Wei Hao, through an interpreter. “Whether it was a penalty or not, I didn’t see it clearly, I need to watch a video afterwards,\"\n\nOutside of the late penalty, Canada was uninspiring, but they will take the three points for the win and move on.\n\nIt might have helped had their opponent been interesting in engaging, but the Chinese were out to survive, forcing Canada to do most of the heavy lifting.\n\n“Only five or six years ago, Canada would have been defending in a huge block against the Chinese, who were among the best soccer nations in the world,” Herdman said. “I’m really proud that Canada can come out and dominate a game in terms of the possession and sneak a win. That’s what we wanted, the three points that’s the most important part.”\n\nThe result gives Canada the leg up in Group A, with games against New Zealand and Netherlands left to play.\n\nConsidering the magnitude of the event, the Canadians could be excused for being tentative against a Chinese team set up to absorb pressure. The Canadians were limited to a handful of chances in the contest, the majority coming in the fist half.\n\nKadeisha Buchanan had the first good opportunity of the game, three minutes in, when a free kick from Sophie Schmidt fell to her at the far post.\n\nBuchanan hammered a shot that was stopped by Chinese goalkeeper Fei Wang, who also got in the way of the rebound.\n\nSinclair came close five minutes later, sent in on a ball over the top by Melissa Tancredi. Sinclair got to it behind the Chinese defensive line but sailed her left-foot attempt just wide.\n\nChina’s best two opportunities came via giveaways from Canadian centre back Lauren Sesselmann. The first on a back pass that fell short, forcing goalkeeper Erin McLeod to dive out at the feet of Chinese striker Shanshan Wang to take the ball away.\n\nThe second came when Sesselmann missed Desire Scott with a square ball at the back, forcing the midfielder to take down Wang, who intercepted the pass. Scott was booked for the late tackle and Wang went on to rattle the ball off the crossbar then down onto the goalpost and out.\n\nCanada countered China’s close call with one of their own, as Belanger splintered the crossbar after goalkeeper Wang punched a cross out to her.\n\n“I was happy we got that win, it was an amazing atmosphere to go off and kick off the World Cup in front of 50,000-plus fans,” said Schmidt, who was voted player of the game. “The heat was something special (Saturday) was well, but I’m so proud of our team we pushed through and got the win. The first half was a little rough, but we found our feet, and in the second half, we never let up.”\n\nIn the second half, Canada tried to increase the pressure, but were still tentative coming forward in order to keep from giving up a goal against the run of play.\n\nThe Chinese were content to put most of their players behind the ball and only threatened when Canada got sloppy with possession.\n\nUnable to work their way through a sea of bodies in the penalty area, Canadian coach tried to inject some energy into his squad by bringing on Kaylyn Kyle, Jesse Fleming and Leon.\n\nAs the game headed into extra time, Leon and Zhao got tangled battling for a ball in the penalty area, leading to the Canadian victory.\n\n“China sat back and kind of dared us to come at them, and finally something went our way,” Schmidt said. “And Sincy, oh captain, my captain, came through and I’m glad she put that in.”","authors":["Derek Van Diest"],"feed-id":429,"published":"2015-06-07T15:21:27Z"},{"description":"President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Amaju Pinnick has assured players and officials of the Super Falcons of the Federation’s committment to provide all their needs that will make them excel at the FIFA Women’s World Cup which gets underway in Canada next month.
